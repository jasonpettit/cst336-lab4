      <h8><b>Distance From Sun:</b> Mercury has the most eccentric orbit of all the planets; its eccentricity 
        is 0.21 with its distance from the Sun ranging from 46,000,000 to 70,000,000 km (29,000,000 to 43,000,000 mi)</h8>

        Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. Its orbit around the Sun takes only 87.97 days, 
        the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System. It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger of the gods.  
        Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from
        the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28Â°. This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near 
        the western horizon after sunset or eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. At this time, it 
        may appear as a bright star-like object, but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus. 
        The planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, as it moves 
        in its inner orbit relative to Earth, which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 116 days.<br>
